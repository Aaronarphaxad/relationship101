    <h2>Reassurance and negative beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      Too much reassurance seeking isn't healthy and is counterproductive to your insecurity. It just fuels an anxiety cycle and only provides short-term relief. It can also be exhausting to the person providing reassurance and make them feel like their efforts are ineffective. Notice and challenge the negative beliefs you have of yourself/the world. "I don't deserve love", "all men cheat", "women just want money". When we don't notice them, we unknowingly and unfairly project them onto romantic partners.

        About your mood and asking for space

  <section class="section section2">
    <h2>What do you do when you're in a bad mood?</h2>
    <p>
      Notice your bad moods and don't project them onto your partner. Realising that you're in low spirits and mentioning it can help. "I had a terrible day at work today it's left me in a bad mood, I'm just gonna take time to cool off so I don't unknowingly get antsy with you".
      Be mindful of the space you ask for. It can worry your partner so let them know why. If it takes longer than usual, send updates: "hey hope you're well, thanks for respecting the space I asked for, still clearing my head but I can't wait until we can spend time together again".

        Uncertainty and effort

  <section class="section section3">
    <h2>A for effort!</h2>
    <p>
      Continuous effort helps. Date nights and spending time on joint hobbies maintains your bond. Along with continuous expressions of love. It can also be stress relieving.
      Realise when you introduce uncertainty. Uncertainty is inevitable but can be a big trigger. Be as clear about what you are certain and uncertain about and offer empathy. "I don't mean to throw you off but I can't commit to that right now, I'll update you when my schedule clears".

       Appreciation and checking in
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <section class="section section4">
    <h2>I appreciate you!</h2>
    <p>
      Take time to appreciate the "unnoticeable" things (e.g. the time/money your partner sets aside to see you and the effort they put into looking good/arranging things etc).
      Check in with your partner. If you notice their mood is off or you just have a general desire for understanding something, ask and don't assume. "I noticed you've been quite low in energy and aren't as responsive, is everything okay? Have I done something to offend you?"

    </div>
    <section class="section section5">
      <h2>Say something</h2>
      <p>
        Communicate your needs directly and clearly instead of expecting them to be automatically known. E.g. "may I have a hug please?", "I'm feeling stressed, can I just vent and be listened to please?".
        Have hard conversations in good conditions. If there's a serious matter to discuss, bring it up when all the person's needs are met. Don't do it when they're prone to being irritable e.g. after a hard day at work, when they're hungry/tired etc.
        Give the benefit of the doubt about your partner's intentions, ask when unsure. Instead of "you're always so dismissive", say "what did you mean when you said that?", "that seemed like a dismissive thing to say, is that how you meant it?"

           Withdrawal of attention
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <section class="section section6">
        <h2>Beware!</h2>
        <p>
          A pattern you don't want to get hooked on is attraction to someone's withdrawal. Withdrawal of energy, effort and attention tends to leave people feeling anxious and very stirred up emotionally, this causes them to pursue and imitates feelings of attachment.
          This simple technique is used to make you reactionary and to gain control. Over time, the more you do this, the more passionate you'll become about turbulence. You'll be put off by consistency and stability because it won't inspire that whirlwind in you. Retrain yourself to be attracted to action, affection and evidence of love. Not to be excited by the push-pull dynamic that means you're getting crumbs of effort in small doses but keeps you in a stimulating anticipation.
          It is popularly known that withdrawal of affection is useful to get people hooked on you, that's why you get people telling you that they don't want to over-compliment you so you don't get too big-headed and sayings like "treat them mean, keep them keen". Don't fall for it.
